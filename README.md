# machine [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/markosamuli/machine.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/markosamuli/machine)

Machine setup, powered by Ansible. 

I've just got a new laptop running Ubuntu 16.04 and I'm working on getting my environment set up, more or less from scratch. I have not tested any of these on my OS X systems.

This is forked off from (caarlos0/machine)[https://github.com/caarlos0/machine] with my specific requirements and updates.

(caarlos0)[https://github.com/caarlos0] suggested splitting the tasks into roles that could be a good idea, especially for running tests in Travis CI, but for now this works quite nicely as I can keep all the files in one place.
